# Decentralized Medicine

What if medicine was easily and freely accessible? 

Did you know there is one biologist for every thousand people? And that biologists receive more publish or perish pressure than most other professionals?

This amounts to a tremendous amount of research publications in the field of biology and medicine that no human can hope to read in a lifetime.

As a result doctors are working with an outdated education even before they complete their education.

This is not so for language models, which can and do read every single word on the internet.

By specializing a large language model to medicine one can obsolete every healthcare professional on the planet.

I have chosen not to productize this as medicine and medical advice should be free.

Text me with your email for free advice, which for legal reasons is not medical but religious, thank you.
