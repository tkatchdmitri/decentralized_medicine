# Medicine Without Healthcare

What if medicine was easily and freely accessible? 

Did you know there is almost 1 biologist per every thousand people? And that biologists receive more publish or perish pressure than most other professionals?

This amounts to a tremendous amount of research publications in the field of biology and medicine that no human can hope to read in a lifetime.

As a result doctors working with an outdated education even before they complete their education.

This is not so for language models, which can and do read every single word on the internet.

I have chosen not to productize this.

Medicine and medical advice should be free.

Text me with your email for free advice, which for legal reasons is not medical but religious, thank you.
